# Spaceage-Reborn

Development of the `codename spaceage-reborn` modpack.

[Technic page](https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/galacticage-reborn.1950730) | 6-8GB RAM required.

Sadly due to GalacticCraft not being ready for 1.16.5, along with no ETA available, modpack will still be based around the 1.12.2 version of the game.

A rewrite of the modpack **will** in the future, for 1.16.5. It will be just an update to the existing one.

Hopefully by the time this project is planned on release (`June of 2023`) the "core mod" will be released.
